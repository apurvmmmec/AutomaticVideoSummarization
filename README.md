## Video Summarization Using TimeLapse

* Summarize Lengthy Videos for quick glance catchup

 * Videos contain many scenes where either the scene contents have no or very less activities for long time and considerable amount of activities for shorter durations , Eg reception of building, less busy car park

 * Videos also contains scenes where despite of activities, the scene content varies very less from frame to frame for eg. a car driving on a highway with stretches which are uniform and smooth with no overtaking or turns and some stretches with lots of overtaking and turns.


### Videos used in this code are from following sources
